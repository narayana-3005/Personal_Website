My Projects:
Age and Gender Detection Project
 Led a team in developing a CNN-based age and gender detection system using Python, TensorFlow, and
OpenCV.
 Collected and preprocessed a large dataset of facial images for training and testing the model.
 Implemented and trained a CNN architecture achieving 79% accuracy in real-time age and gender
classification.
 Optimized the model for efficient processing on CPU/GPU architectures, resulting in a 85% improvement
in performance.
Credit Card Fraud Detection Project
 Spearheaded the development of a credit card fraud detection system leveraging advanced ML
techniques.
 Conducted thorough preprocessing and analysis of a large dataset of credit card transactions to unveil
intricate patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior.
 Successfully implemented and optimized machine learning models, achieving an impressive detection
accuracy of 80% on the validation dataset.
 Deployed the trained model as a cloud-based service using Amazon SageMaker, enabling real-time fraud
detection for online transactions.
 Played a pivotal role in contributing to the university project, resulting in a notable reduction in fraudulent
losses and enhanced financial security.
